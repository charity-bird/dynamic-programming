# Dynamic Programming 

A collection of interesting dynamic programming problems and their solutions in java.

### Problem 1: Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem

Given a set of jobs with start times, end times and weights corresponding to each job,
find the maximum weight subset of mutually compatible jobs. Two jobs are compatible if
they don't overlap in time.

### Problem 2: Knapsack Problem

Given n objects and a "knapsack," where item i weighs wi > 0 kilograms and has value 
vi > 0, and where Knapsack has capacity of W kilograms, fill the knapsack so as to 
maximumize the total value of the items selected.

### Problem 3: Maximum Contiguous Subarray

Given a list of integers find the contiguous sublist with maximum sum and return that 
integer.
